# Battleship Game Simulation

##[Demo](https://link-url-here.org)

## Based on the rules of the Battleship board game. A program which randomly places ships on two boards and simulates gameplay between 2 players. I'm planning to develop the program with more ideas in the future.

This project was created as a recruitment task for software house. I decided to put some effort in visual aspects as it is also one of my portfolio projects. I also decided to add a restart button so user doesn't have to refresh the page when match ends.
